PHP Semantic Versioning Checker for `git` is a console/library which allows you to inspect a set of before and after source code using GIT.

The command line utility will use an existing `git` repository to compare to changesets using anything `git checkout` would accept (sha1, branch, tag). It will checkout in `detached` mode in order not to pollute your list of branches.

**Note** It is strongly suggested you do not run this directly on any repository you do not want to lose. Make a copy of it beforehand and run `php-semver-checker-git` on that copy instead.

## Getting started

1. Install `php-semver-checker-git` through composer, either globally or locally:

Locally
```bash
php composer require --dev tomzx/php-semver-checker-git
```

Globally
```bash
php composer global require tomzx/php-semver-checker-git
```

See the example section for examples of how to use the tool.

## Example

```bash
# arguments are: repository-directory before-commit/branch/tag after-commit/branch/tag before-source after-source
php bin/php-semver-checker-git compare factory-muffin v1.6.4 v2.0.0 factory-muffin/src factory-muffin/src
